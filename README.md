# Moody Tunes

This project was created by UF COP3503 students Ruo Chen, Devin Rodriguez, and Leslie Harvey as their final project for Fall 2020 Semester.

Moody Tunes is not to be copied by anyone (UF rules).

Moody Tunes is a web-based app that allows users to input values using sliders to match their mood. These values are calculated into a single value and the program calls upon a database compiled using Spotify's database and API to return a playlist of 20 songs that best fit the given mood.

To get this to work, pull the repository, navigate to moody-tunes in the terminal and run npm install, npm start, and the website should pop up.
Spotify authentication token required.
