          With a system designed to make flipped classrooms more effective, 
          adaptable quizzes allow each student to have a personalized experience 
          that is tailored to their unique potential. Instructors ensure that every 
          student reaches a minimum level of understanding of the concepts before 
          the class and students are encouraged to develop their mastery in the course content.
